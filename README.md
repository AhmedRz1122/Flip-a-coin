# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

  # Coin Flip Animation

This project is a simple coin flip animation built using **React (JSX)**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It simulates the action of flipping a coin and dynamically displays either a "Head" or "Tail" image with an animated rotation effect.

## Features

- Flip a coin with a click of a button.
- Smooth coin flip animation using CSS transforms.
- Displays head or tail image based on random coin flip result.
- Visual feedback with conditional rendering for "Head" or "Tail."
- Responsive and modern design with hover effects for the flip button.

## Technologies Used

- **React (JSX)** for UI and component-based architecture.
- **CSS** for styling and animations.
- **JavaScript** for handling coin flip logic and state management.

## How It Works

1. Click the **Flip** button to start the animation.
2. The coin rotates and simulates a flip animation using the `animate()` function.
3. The result of the flip (Head or Tail) is randomly generated using `Math.random()`.
4. The corresponding image (head or tail) is displayed along with a label.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coin-flip-animation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd coin-flip-animation
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Future Improvements

- Add sound effects for the coin flip.
- Implement more advanced animations and 3D effects.
- Add a feature to count the number of heads and tails.
